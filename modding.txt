UW Exporter now supports loading of TGA files in place of sprites loaded by .gr files, textures in .tr files, bitmaps in .byt maps and critter animations in page files

Instructions

In the game data folder (eg c:\uw1\data ) create a new folder and name it the same as the data file you want to override and replace the dot with an underscore
EG to replace object sprite art create a folder called objects_gr.
Within the folder you can place your replacement art. The files should be named 001.tga, 002.tga etc.  
Note the TGALoader currently requires 24 or 32 bit depth.

For .byt files just name the file 001.tga in the folder

For textures note that in UW1 floor and wall textures are split across two files but in Exporter the textures are loaded into a single data structure.
Create seperate folders for each file as described but in the folder for floor textures offset the texture index by plus 210.
Animated textures use a palette shifted shader to animate so the game will expect a greyscale file to be loaded to appear properly.

For critter animation frames you will have to do the following to support the different auxilary palettes the game has for critters.
In the CRIT folder create a new folder as above (eg cr14page_n00 for file cr14page.n00). 
Within this folder create another folder for the palette index. This will be either 0, 1 or 2.
Then within that folder create the tga file as above.

See the attached uw1_object_settings.txt files and uw1_retro_config.txt files to get a listing of what some of the files contain.
