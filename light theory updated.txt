Values at offset +24 and +25 of the subclass define the possible values of the shade adjustments. N

Lighting Operations are stored in offset +16      
(badly eyeballed)

00= On and off.
01= Light pulses on and off
02= ditto
04= ditto


If appears the +24 and +25 offsets control the upper and lower shade adjustments in nibbles. There may be a bit flag here though
as the behaviour is not always as expected for the values entered.
