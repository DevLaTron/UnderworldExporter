//Probably used to teleport to an other world possible based on the state of the other gem hack trap and probably based on the players position.

		//One thing to note: there is an invisible rotary switch near this trap. Making this visible and using changes the available face
		//on the gem and what level you can go to.
		//It's linked to the variable no 6 via a set_variable_trap. Seems like that variable controls what level the teleport goes to. (untested)


		// this has a quality of 55d
