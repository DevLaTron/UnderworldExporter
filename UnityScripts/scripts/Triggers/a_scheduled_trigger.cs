		//Theory -untested
		//This trigger is fired when a particular variable is set.
		//Possible usage to turn the gem room into ice when the ice caverns are first visited..

		//Probably reads the same variables as those set by set variables so zpos is the likely index used here.
		//Possible uses xclock variables

		//Known examples
		//for fizzit
		//X clock 15 = 1 or quest 119 to 1
		//Activates the following trigger
